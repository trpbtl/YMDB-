## üóÉ Database Design

YEFLIX uses a **normalized relational schema** optimized for performance and scalability:

### Core Entities
- **MOVIES**: Title, genre, rating, release year, poster URLs, trailer integration
- **ACTORS**: Comprehensive actor profiles with biographical data and filmographies  
- **CAST**: Many-to-many relationship table linking actors to movies with role details
- **REVIEWS**: User-generated ratings, comments, and review timestamps
- **WATCHLIST** *(integrated)*: User movie preferences and viewing intentions
- **USERS** *(planned)*: Authentication, personalization, and user preferences

### Data Integrity Features
- Foreign key constraints ensuring referential integrity
- Indexes on frequently queried columns (genre, release_year, rating)
- Triggers for automated data validation and audit trails
- Views for complex reporting and analytics queries
